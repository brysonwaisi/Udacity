            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons coffee</li>
                <li>4 ounces water</li>
                <li>4 ounces milk</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, steam the milk. Heat 1 cup of milk in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Let the milk simmer until bubbles form around the edges, but don’t boil the milk. Remove the pan from heat and set it on a flat surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, whip the milk with an electric mixer, increasing the speed as the milk begins to thicken. Continue mixing until you get the desired volume of froth.
                </li>
                <li>Now, make the coffee. Measure 2 tablespoons of grounds for 5 to 6 ounces of water. Try using Folgers French Roast Coffee for a full-bodied taste, or make it with Folgers® Classic Decaf Coffee for less caffeine. You can brew the coffee
                    in an automatic drip coffeemaker or a French press.</li>

                <li>Now, make the cappuccino! A classic cappuccino calls for 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk, and 1/3 foam. You can mix it up by using 2 or 3 tablespoons of flavored syrups or even different kinds of milk, like chocolate or vanilla.</li>
